# Sunpech's dotfiles

My dotfiles for MacOS. This will help you/me get started setting up a fresh new MacOS setup. *(Ubuntu Linux not currently supported).*

I use [GNU stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage symlinks for configurations.

## Requirements

You need to run z shell (zsh), which is default on MacOS since macOS Catalina, in 2019.

You'll need to have [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed. 

Then you'll need git and stow to install this dotfiles repository.

```
brew install git stow
```

## Installation

### Clone repo (with submodules)

```
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:sunpech/dotfiles.git

mv dotfiles ~/.dotfiles

cd ~/.dotfiles
```

### Run stow

Use stow to create symlinks for config files. 

I disagree with running ```stow .``` at the top of the project directory to symlink everything. I think it's better to organize by directory where it's more modular, which is what the approach of this repo.

```
stow zsh ohmyzsh alacritty powerlevel10k nvim vim git
```

After running stow above, you should be setup with your dotfiles. You may want to install extras, or even update some submodules-- see sections below.

## Terminals

* [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/) with [Alacritty themes](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty-theme)
* [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/) with [iTerm2 color schemes](http://iterm2colorschemes.com/)
* [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/)

## Z shell (zsh)

I use [ohmyz.sh](https://ohmyz.sh/) (Also see: [ohmyzsh Github](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)) and [powerlevel10k theme](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k).

I no longer use bash, or [Fish Shell](https://fishshell.com/) with [oh-my-fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish).

## Submodules
There are 2 submodules in this project:

1. [ohmyzsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)
2. [alacritty-theme](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty-theme)

Be sure to read [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11420701/git-submodule-is-returning-blank/40426513). In short, run:

```
git submodule update
```

Other commands:

f you already cloned the repository without submodules, you can manually initialize and update them:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

After pulling changes to the main repository, you may also need to pull updates for submodules if they have changed. You can use the following command:
```
git submodule update --remote --merge
```
