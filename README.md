Steven Suwatanapongched's Dotfiles
========

Always a work in progress.

Hoping to use this between my Mac and Ubuntu machines.

TODO
----
The repo is a folder named: dotfiles/

Rename this to .dotfiles and place it in your home directory.

Create a symlink between your home directory's .bash_profile and .dotfiles/.bash_profile.

ln -s /Users/sunpech/.bash_profile /Users/sunpech/.dotfiles/.bash_profile

And you're set Future Steven!
