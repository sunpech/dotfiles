# Steven's Dotfiles

Always a work in progress. Hoping to use this between my Mac and Ubuntu machines. This initially started on my Mac OS X, but is being improved to also work on Ubuntu.

## Requirements
You should have necessary apps installed already. Applications such as Git, Rails, Mongodb, Postgres, Android SDK, MySQL, etc. This repo does not install all that for you. The PATH is set in the .bash_profile file.

## Installation
1. Rename dotfiles/  to .dotfiles and place it in your home directory.
2. cd into .dotfiles directory.
3. Run chmod u+x install.sh
4. Run ./install.sh
